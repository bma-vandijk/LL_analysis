# Lowlands Whispers

## Intro
This is the repo for the analysis of the Lowlands Chinese Whispers 2019 data.
It consists of 3 different Dutch stories retold in a chain of usually 6 individuals.

The file names consist of the first to numbers indicating the story ID: 03, 13 and 23 indicate the 'kipfilet' story, 02, 12, and 22 the 'rode pet' story, and 01, 11 and 21 indicate the 'koffiebekers' story.  
The last two numbers indicate where in the chain we are, with 00 being the seed story, thus usually ending with 06, e.g. 0206.
